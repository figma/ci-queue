  keep the current strategy, and add a new one that supports reading in a test "timing" file and ordering
   in descending order by the known test duration. If one can't be found, it should fallback to an 
  estimated value that is configurable (let's say this defaults to 100ms). The input file will be a JSON 
  file with a dictionary where the keys are the test name, in the format 
  "${test_class_name}#${test_name}", and the value is a tuple of the duration and the result. If the 
  result is either skipped or failed, we should use the fallback in case actually running the test takes 
  longer than expected. We expect this will solve an issue with load balancing where longer running tests
   are placed towards the end of the queue and workers are stuck waiting for a small number of longer 
  running tests to finish. 
  Don't write any code yet. Think really hard and come up with a plan, and validate any assumptions I've 
  made in my instructions. Readability and extensibility should be a priority when creating this 
  solution.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to add a new queuing strategy to the Ruby/Minitest integration in this ci-queue library.
   Let me understand what they're asking for:

  1. They want to support different "strategies" of ordering the queue
  2. Keep the current strategy 
  3. Add a new one that reads a test timing file
  4. Order tests in descending order by known test duration
  5. If duration not found, use a configurable fallback (default 100ms)
  6. Input file is JSON: {"test_class#test_name": [duration, result]}
  7. If result is "skipped" or "failed", use fallback duration
  8. Goal is to improve load balancing by putting longer tests earlier in the queue

  I need to:
  1. First understand the current codebase structure
  2. See how the current queuing/ordering works
  3. Identify where strategies should be implemented
  4. Come up with a clean, extensible design
  5. Validate the user's assumptions

  Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the current implementation.

⏺ I'll help you design a strategy system for test ordering in the Ruby/Minitest integration. Let me first
   explore the codebase to understand the current implementation and then create a comprehensive plan.

  Let me start by exploring the project structure to understand how it's organized.

⏺ List(..)
  ⎿  Listed 208 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the directory structure, I can see this is a multi-language project with implementations for
   JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. The user is asking about the Ruby/Minitest integration specifically. Let
   me explore the Ruby directory structure more closely to understand the current implementation.

  From what I can see:
  - ruby/lib/ci/queue/ - contains the core queue logic 
  - ruby/lib/minitest/queue/ - contains minitest-specific implementations
  - ruby/exe/minitest-queue - the executable
  - ruby/lib/ci/queue/redis/worker.rb - this was the file the user opened, so it's relevant

  Let me look at the minitest integration files to understand how tests are currently ordered/queued.

⏺ List(lib)
  ⎿  Listed 54 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me examine the main files to understand the current architecture. I'll start with the main entry 
  points and then dive into the specifics of test ordering.

⏺ Read(lib/minitest/queue.rb)
  ⎿  Read 283 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(lib/ci/queue.rb)
  ⎿  Read 56 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(exe/minitest-queue)
  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to look at the runner to understand how tests are loaded and queued, and then examine the 
  queue implementations. Let me check the runner file:

⏺ Read(lib/minitest/queue/runner.rb)
  ⎿  Read 623 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see how the current system works. The key parts are:

  1. In runner.rb:297, tests are populated into the queue with populate_queue which calls:
  Minitest.queue.populate(Minitest.loaded_tests, random: ordering_seed, &:id)
  2. The loaded_tests method in /Users/ebarajas/figma/ci-queue/ruby/lib/minitest/queue.rb:203-209 returns
   a flat list of SingleExample objects:
  def loaded_tests
    Minitest::Test.runnables.flat_map do |runnable|
      runnable.runnable_methods.map do |method_name|
        SingleExample.new(runnable, method_name)
      end
    end
  end
  3. The SingleExample.id method (line 158) returns "#{@runnable}##{@method_name}" which matches the 
  format the user mentioned.
  4. Looking at /Users/ebarajas/figma/ci-queue/ruby/lib/ci/queue.rb:31-37, there's already a shuffling 
  mechanism:
  def shuffle(tests, random)
    if shuffler
      shuffler.call(tests, random)
    else
      tests.sort.shuffle(random: random)
    end
  end

  So the current system uses a shuffle approach with a pluggable shuffler callback. Now I need to 
  understand how the queue implementations work to see where to add the strategy system.

  Let me look at the queue implementations:

     ☐ Design extensible strategy pattern for test ordering
     ☐ Analyze timing file format and validate assumptions
     ☐ Create implementation plan with clear interfaces and responsibilities

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me examine the queue implementation to understand how the populate method works and where the 
  ordering happens:

⏺ Search(pattern: "def populate", path: "lib")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me look at the static queue implementation and the redis worker to understand how populate works:

⏺ Read(lib/ci/queue/static.rb)
  ⎿  Read 118 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(lib/ci/queue/redis/worker.rb)
  ⎿  Read 260 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I can see how the current ordering works:

  1. In the Redis Worker (line 31-36):
  def populate(tests, random: Random.new)
    @index = tests.map { |t| [t.id, t] }.to_h
    tests = Queue.shuffle(tests, random)  # <-- THIS IS WHERE ORDERING HAPPENS
    push(tests.map(&:id))
    self
  end
  2. And from the main Queue module I read earlier (ci/queue.rb:31-37), Queue.shuffle calls either a 
  custom shuffler or the default sort+shuffle:
  def shuffle(tests, random)
    if shuffler
      shuffler.call(tests, random)
    else
      tests.sort.shuffle(random: random)  # <-- DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
    end
  end

  So the current system:
  - Has a pluggable shuffler mechanism via CI::Queue.shuffler
  - Default behavior is to sort tests alphabetically and then shuffle them randomly
  - This happens at the populate phase before pushing to Redis
  - The shuffle affects both Redis and Static queue implementations

  Now let me complete understanding the current system and then design the strategy system:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Explore current codebase structure and understand existing queuing mechanism

     ☐ Analyze timing file format and validate assumptions
     ☐ Design extensible strategy pattern for test ordering
     ☐ Create implementation plan with clear interfaces and responsibilities

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me analyze the timing file format and validate the user's assumptions:

  The user specified:
  1. JSON file format 
  2. Dictionary where keys are test names in format "${test_class_name}#${test_name}"
  3. Values are tuples [duration, result]
  4. If result is "skipped" or "failed", use fallback duration 
  5. Default fallback is 100ms

  This matches perfectly with the SingleExample.id format I saw in the minitest integration: 
  "#{@runnable}##{@method_name}" which becomes something like "MyTestClass#test_something".

  Let me check if there are any existing test timing mechanisms in this codebase:

⏺ Search(pattern: "timing|duration|time", path: "lib")
  ⎿  Found 20 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  There are existing test time tracking mechanisms! Let me examine the test time related files:

⏺ Read(lib/minitest/queue/test_time_recorder.rb)
  ⎿  Read 18 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(lib/ci/queue/redis/test_time_record.rb)
  ⎿  Read 66 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Interesting! There's already a test time tracking system in place. Let me also check the test time 
  reporter to understand the output format:

⏺ Read(lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb)
  ⎿  Read 71 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a complete understanding of the current system and can validate the user's assumptions and 
  move to the design phase:

  Current System Analysis:

  1. Test Loading: Tests are loaded via loaded_tests method which creates SingleExample objects with id 
  format "TestClass#test_method"
  2. Current Ordering: Tests are ordered via CI::Queue.shuffle(tests, random) which either:
    - Uses a custom CI::Queue.shuffler callback if set 
    - Default: tests.sort.shuffle(random: random) (alphabetical + random shuffle)
  3. Existing Timing System: There's already a test time tracking system that:
    - Records test durations in Redis (TestTimeRecord)
    - Can export timing data via TestTimeReporter 
    - Tracks durations in milliseconds
    - Only records passed tests (line 11 in test_time_recorder.rb)

  User's Requirements Analysis:

  ✅ Test ID Format: Matches exactly - "#{test_class}##{test_method}"✅ JSON Input: Reasonable and 
  standard✅ Duration + Result Tuple: Makes sense - [duration, result]✅ Skip failed/skipped tests: Good 
  for load balancing (unreliable timing)✅ Fallback duration: Essential for unknown tests✅ Descending 
  order: Logical for load balancing (longest tests first)  

  Potential Issues to Address:

  1. Integration with existing shuffle: Need to work alongside current shuffler mechanism
  2. Configuration: Need to specify timing file path and fallback duration  
  3. Graceful fallbacks: If file missing, corrupt, or partially missing data
  4. Strategy interface: Need clean way to switch between current shuffle vs timing-based
  5. File format validation: JSON parsing errors, invalid format handling

  Let me move to the design phase:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Explore current codebase structure and understand existing queuing mechanism
     ☒ Identify current test ordering/queueing logic in Ruby/Minitest integration
     ☒ Analyze timing file format and validate assumptions
     ☐ Design extensible strategy pattern for test ordering
     ☐ Create implementation plan with clear interfaces and responsibilities

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me design the extensible strategy pattern for test ordering and create the implementation plan.

  Strategy Pattern Design

  Based on my analysis, here's what I think the best approach would be:

  Current State

  - Tests are ordered via CI::Queue.shuffle(tests, random) in redis/worker.rb:33
  - This calls either a custom CI::Queue.shuffler callback or default tests.sort.shuffle(random: random)

  Proposed Design

  1. Replace shuffler with strategy pattern: Instead of a single shuffler callback, use a strategy 
  interface that can handle different ordering algorithms
  2. Strategy Interface: Create a base strategy class with a standard interface
  class CI::Queue::Strategy::Base
    def order_tests(tests, random: Random.new, config:)
      # Override in subclasses
    end
  end
  3. Concrete Strategies:
    - CI::Queue::Strategy::Random (current behavior) 
    - CI::Queue::Strategy::TimingBased (new timing-based strategy)
  4. Configuration: Add strategy selection to the configuration system
  5. Backward Compatibility: Keep the existing shuffler callback for custom use cases

  Strategy Implementation Details

  Random Strategy (preserve current behavior):
  class CI::Queue::Strategy::Random < Base
    def order_tests(tests, random: Random.new, config:)
      tests.sort.shuffle(random: random)
    end
  end

  Timing-Based Strategy:
  class CI::Queue::Strategy::TimingBased < Base
    def order_tests(tests, random: Random.new, config:)
      # 1. Load timing data from JSON file
      # 2. Sort by duration (descending) with fallback
      # 3. Handle missing/failed tests with fallback duration
    end



  I'll design a flexible test ordering mechanism that allows dynamic strategy selection and 
  configuration. The approach provides a clean, extensible way to implement different test ordering 
  algorithms while maintaining existing functionality.

  The strategy pattern enables easy addition of new ordering methods like timing-based sorting, with 
  minimal changes to the core queuing system. Configuration options will allow fine-grained control over 
  test ordering behavior.

  Key implementation points include creating a base strategy class, defining concrete strategies, and 
  integrating the new approach with the existing configuration and shuffling mechanisms.

  Great! I've completed my analysis and planning. Now let me provide the user with my comprehensive plan 
  and validate any assumptions they made.

⏺ Plan: Test Ordering Strategy System for Ruby/Minitest Integration

  Analysis & Validation

  Your requirements are well-aligned with the existing codebase. Here's what I found:

  ✅ Test ID Format: Perfect match - the system already uses "#{test_class}##{test_method}" format✅ JSON
   Timing File: Straightforward to implement with your [duration, result] tuple format✅ Existing 
  Infrastructure: There's already a test timing system that could be leveraged✅ Load Balancing Goal:
  Makes complete sense - putting longer tests first prevents workers waiting

  Current System Architecture

  The current ordering happens in ci/queue/redis/worker.rb:33:
  tests = Queue.shuffle(tests, random)  # Current ordering point

  This calls CI::Queue.shuffle which supports a pluggable shuffler callback or defaults to
  tests.sort.shuffle(random: random).

  Proposed Design: Strategy Pattern

  1. Strategy Interface
  # lib/ci/queue/strategy/base.rb
  class CI::Queue::Strategy::Base
    def order_tests(tests, random: Random.new, config:)
      raise NotImplementedError
    end
  end

  2. Concrete Strategies

  Random Strategy (preserve existing behavior):
  # lib/ci/queue/strategy/random.rb
  class CI::Queue::Strategy::Random < Base
    def order_tests(tests, random: Random.new, config:)
      tests.sort.shuffle(random: random)
    end
  end

  Timing-Based Strategy (your new requirement):
  # lib/ci/queue/strategy/timing_based.rb  
  class CI::Queue::Strategy::TimingBased < Base
    def order_tests(tests, random: Random.new, config:)
      timing_data = load_timing_data(config.timing_file)

      tests.sort_by do |test|
        duration = get_test_duration(test.id, timing_data, config.timing_fallback_duration)
        -duration # Negative for descending order (longest first)
      end
    end

    private

    def load_timing_data(file_path)
      # Parse JSON: {"TestClass#test_method": [duration_ms, result]}
    end

    def get_test_duration(test_id, timing_data, fallback_duration)
      entry = timing_data[test_id]
      return fallback_duration unless entry

      duration, result = entry
      # Use fallback for failed/skipped tests per your requirement
      return fallback_duration if %w[failed skipped].include?(result.to_s.downcase)

      duration.to_f
    end
  end

  3. Configuration Extension

  Add to CI::Queue::Configuration:
  - strategy - symbol (:random, :timing_based)
  - timing_file - path to JSON file
  - timing_fallback_duration - default duration in ms (default: 100)

  4. CLI Integration

  Add to minitest/queue/runner.rb parser:
  - --strategy STRATEGY - choose ordering strategy
  - --timing-file PATH - path to timing file
  - --timing-fallback DURATION - fallback duration in ms

  5. Backward Compatibility

  Keep existing CI::Queue.shuffler callback working alongside the new strategy system.

  Implementation Steps

  1. Create Strategy Base Class - Define interface
  2. Implement Random Strategy - Extract existing behavior
  3. Implement TimingBased Strategy - Core new functionality
  4. Update Configuration - Add new config options
  5. Modify Core Queue.shuffle - Use strategy pattern
  6. Update Runner CLI - Add new command line options
  7. Add Tests - Unit tests for strategies and integration tests
  8. Update Documentation - Document new options

  File Structure

  lib/ci/queue/
  ├── strategy/
  │   ├── base.rb           # Strategy interface
  │   ├── random.rb         # Current behavior
  │   └── timing_based.rb   # New timing strategy
  ├── configuration.rb      # Extended with new options
  └── redis/worker.rb       # Modified to use strategies

  Error Handling & Edge Cases

  - Missing timing file: Graceful fallback to random strategy with warning
  - Malformed JSON: Parse error handling with fallback
  - Partially missing timing data: Mixed approach (timed + fallback tests)
  - File read permissions: Clear error messages

  Benefits of This Design

  ✅ Extensible: Easy to add new strategies (e.g., historical performance-based)✅ Maintainable: Clear
  separation of concerns✅ Backward Compatible: Existing functionality preserved✅ Configurable: Multiple
   configuration methods✅ Testable: Each strategy can be unit tested independently

  Does this plan address your requirements correctly? Any concerns or adjustments you'd like me to make 
  before implementation?

> This looks great so far. Let's add one additional thing
  Currently I've added the test timing as a custom plugin, however I think it's better suited to live 
  inside this library. The library already records test timings as you noticed, let's extend it to 
  support outputting the test timing to a JSON file.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to extend the existing timing functionality in the library to output test timing data to
   a JSON file. Looking at what I found earlier:

  1. The library already has test timing functionality:
    - minitest/queue/test_time_recorder.rb - records test times during execution
    - ci/queue/redis/test_time_record.rb - stores test times in Redis
    - minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb - reports on test times
  2. The current system:
    - Records test times in Redis during execution
    - Can report on tests that exceed time limits
    - Already tracks test duration in milliseconds
    - Already has the test name in the right format

  So the user wants to extend this to also output to a JSON file in the format they specified: 
  {"TestClass#test_method": [duration_ms, result]}.

  I should update my plan to include:
  1. Extending the existing test time recorder to optionally write to JSON file
  2. Making sure we capture the test result (passed/failed/skipped) along with timing
  3. Adding configuration for the JSON output file path
  4. Making this integrate well with the strategy system

  Let me add this to the plan.

⏺ Excellent idea! That makes the system much more cohesive. Let me update the plan to integrate JSON
  timing export into the existing timing infrastructure.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Explore current codebase structure and understand existing queuing mechanism
     ☒ Identify current test ordering/queueing logic in Ruby/Minitest integration
     ☒ Design extensible strategy pattern for test ordering
     ☒ Analyze timing file format and validate assumptions
     ☒ Create implementation plan with clear interfaces and responsibilities
     ☐ Update plan to include JSON timing export functionality

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the existing timing infrastructure, I need to understand how to best integrate the JSON 
  export:

  1. Current TestTimeRecorder: Records only passed tests and duration in 
  minitest/queue/test_time_recorder.rb:11-14
  2. Missing piece: We need to capture the test result (passed/failed/skipped) along with duration
  3. Output location: Currently only stores in Redis, need to add JSON file output
  4. Integration: This should work well with the strategy system - the same JSON file that gets written 
  can be read by the TimingBased strategy

  Key considerations:
  - Need to record ALL tests (not just passed ones) with their results
  - Need to write to JSON file at the end of the run or incrementally
  - Format should match what the strategy expects: {"TestClass#test_method": [duration_ms, "result"]}
  - Should integrate with existing configuration system
  - Should be optional (controlled by CLI flag)

  Let me update the plan accordingly.
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> One correction on your thinking. In this case, I think it's fine to only record the test timing of 
  successful test results and then fallback to a default value in another case since that's effectively 
  what we were planning on doing. Then the json format can just be {"TestClass#test_method": duration_ms}

✻ Thinking…

  The user is simplifying the JSON format and the recording logic. Instead of:
  - Recording all tests with [duration, result] tuples and then filtering during strategy execution
  - They want to only record successful tests in the first place
  - And use a simpler JSON format: {"TestClass#test_method": duration_ms}

  This is actually cleaner! It means:
  1. The TestTimeRecorder only records successful tests (duration only, no result needed)
  2. The JSON export is simpler: just test_id -> duration mapping
  3. The TimingBased strategy becomes simpler - if a test isn't in the timing data, use fallback

  Let me update the plan accordingly.

⏺ Perfect! That's much cleaner. Let me update the plan with this simpler approach.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Explore current codebase structure and understand existing queuing mechanism
     ☒ Identify current test ordering/queueing logic in Ruby/Minitest integration
     ☒ Design extensible strategy pattern for test ordering
     ☒ Update plan to include JSON timing export functionality
     ☒ Analyze timing file format and validate assumptions
     ☒ Create implementation plan with clear interfaces and responsibilities

✻ Thinking…

  Great! This simplifies things significantly:

  1. JSON Format: Just {"TestClass#test_method": duration_ms} - much cleaner
  2. Recording Logic: Only record successful tests (which is what TestTimeRecorder already does at 
  lib/minitest/queue/test_time_recorder.rb:11 return unless test.passed?)  
  3. Strategy Logic: If test not in JSON, use fallback - simple!

  So the updated plan:

  Updated JSON Timing Export Integration

  Current System: TestTimeRecorder already only records passed tests and stores them in Redis.

  New Addition: Export that Redis timing data to JSON format for the next run.

  Modified Components:

  1. TestTimeReporter Enhancement - Add JSON export capability
  2. CLI Options - Add --export-timing-file PATH 
  3. TimingBased Strategy - Simplified to just check existence in timing data
  4. Configuration - Add timing export file option

  Let me show the updated design.

⏺ Updated Plan: Integrated JSON Timing Export + Strategy System

  JSON Timing Export Enhancement

  Perfect! The existing TestTimeRecorder already only records successful tests (return unless 
  test.passed?). We just need to add JSON export capability.

  Enhanced TestTimeReporter:
  # lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb (enhanced)
  class TestTimeReporter < Minitest::Reporters::BaseReporter
    def initialize(build:, limit: nil, percentile: nil, export_file: nil, **options)
      # ... existing code ...
      @export_file = export_file
    end

    def report
      # ... existing report logic ...
      export_timing_data if @export_file
    end

    private

    def export_timing_data
      # Convert test_time_hash to simple format: {"TestClass#method": avg_duration_ms}
      timing_data = test_time_hash.transform_values do |durations|
        durations.sum / durations.size  # Average duration
      end

      File.write(@export_file, JSON.pretty_generate(timing_data))
      puts "Exported timing data to #{@export_file}"
    end
  end

  CLI Integration (add to runner.rb):
  opts.on('--export-timing-file FILE', 'Export test timing data to JSON file') do |file|
    queue_config.export_timing_file = file
  end

  Wire it up in Runner (run_command method):
  reporters << TestTimeReporter.new(
    build: test_time_record,
    export_file: queue_config.export_timing_file
  ) if queue_config.track_test_duration

  Simplified TimingBased Strategy

  Much cleaner now:

  # lib/ci/queue/strategy/timing_based.rb  
  class CI::Queue::Strategy::TimingBased < Base
    def order_tests(tests, random: Random.new, config:)
      timing_data = load_timing_data(config.timing_file)

      tests.sort_by do |test|
        duration = timing_data[test.id] || config.timing_fallback_duration
        -duration # Negative for descending order (longest first)
      end
    end

    private

    def load_timing_data(file_path)
      return {} unless file_path && File.exist?(file_path)

    rescue JSON::ParserError => e
      warn "Warning: Could not parse timing file #{file_path}: #{e.message}"
      {}
    end
  end

  Updated Implementation Steps

  1. Create Strategy System - Base class + Random + TimingBased strategies
  2. Enhance TestTimeReporter - Add JSON export capability
  3. Update Configuration - Add strategy, timing_file, timing_fallback_duration, export_timing_file
  4. Update CLI - Add all new options (--strategy, --timing-file, --timing-fallback,
  --export-timing-file)
  5. Modify Core Queue.shuffle - Use strategy pattern
  6. Integration - Wire up TestTimeReporter with export in Runner
  7. Tests - Unit and integration tests
  8. Documentation - Update CLI help and README

  Complete Workflow

  Run 1 (Bootstrap):
  minitest-queue --track-test-duration --export-timing-file timing.json run
  → Creates timing.json with successful test durations

  Run 2+ (Optimized):
  minitest-queue --strategy timing_based --timing-file timing.json run
  → Uses timing data to order tests (longest first)

  Updated CLI Options

  --strategy STRATEGY           Test ordering strategy: random, timing_based (default: random)
  --timing-file PATH           Path to JSON timing file for timing_based strategy
  --timing-fallback DURATION  Fallback duration in ms for unknown tests (default: 100)
  --export-timing-file PATH    Export test timing data to JSON file after run

  Benefits of Simplified Design

  ✅ Simpler JSON Format: Just test_id → duration mapping✅ Cleaner Logic: Only record successful tests,
  fallback for others✅ Self-Contained: Library handles both timing collection and export✅ Easy 
  Migration: Existing timing infrastructure leveraged✅ Flexible: Can still use external timing files if
  needed

  This covers everything you wanted - integrated timing export plus the strategy system. Does this 
  updated approach look good to proceed with?

> I want to be sure that --track-test-duration and --strategy timing_based aren't mutually exclusive. 
  Ideally after the first bootstrap run, we'd always be updating test duration. 
  I also want to be sure that the JSON export only happens on the when the report command is called, and 
  not on each individual worker that is running

⏺ Excellent points! Let me clarify these important details:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Clarify timing recording vs strategy usage interaction                   
     ☐ Ensure JSON export only happens in report command, not individual workers
     ☐ Design proper workflow for continuous timing updates

⏺ You're absolutely right! Let me analyze the current flow and fix these issues:

⏺ Search(pattern: "report.*command", path: "lib/minitest/queue/runner.rb", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 47 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(lib/minitest/queue/runner.rb)

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Clarify timing recording vs strategy usage interaction                   
     ☒ Ensure JSON export only happens in report command, not individual workers
     ☒ Design proper workflow for continuous timing updates

⏺ Perfect observations! Here's the corrected design:

  Corrected Design: Continuous Timing Updates + Report-Only Export

  1. Timing Recording vs Strategy Usage

  These should always work together after bootstrap:

  Corrected Workflow:
  # Bootstrap (first run)
  minitest-queue --track-test-duration run  # Workers record timing
  minitest-queue report --export-timing-file timing.json  # Export JSON

  # Subsequent runs (optimal)  
  minitest-queue --track-test-duration --strategy timing_based --timing-file timing.json run
  minitest-queue report --export-timing-file timing.json  # Update JSON with new timings

  Key Points:
  - --track-test-duration should always be used to keep timing data fresh
  - --strategy timing_based uses existing timing file for ordering
  - Workers continuously update timing data, report command exports it

  2. JSON Export Location

  You're absolutely right - JSON export belongs in the report command only:

  Current Architecture:
  - Workers (run command): Record timing data to Redis
  - Report (report command): Aggregates results and generates reports

  Enhanced TestTimeReporter (used in report_command):
  # In report_command method, alongside existing BuildStatusReporter
  if queue_config.track_test_duration
    test_time_record = CI::Queue::Redis::TestTimeRecord.new(queue_url, queue_config)
    test_time_reporter = TestTimeReporter.new(
      build: test_time_record,
      limit: queue_config.max_test_duration,
      percentile: queue_config.max_test_duration_percentile,
      export_file: queue_config.export_timing_file  # NEW
    )
    test_time_reporter.report
  end

  3. Updated CLI Design

  For Workers (run command):
  --strategy STRATEGY         # Test ordering strategy (default: random)  
  --timing-file PATH         # Input timing file for timing_based strategy
  --timing-fallback DURATION # Fallback for unknown tests (default: 100ms)
  --track-test-duration      # Record timing data (recommended always on)

  For Report (report command):
  --export-timing-file PATH  # Export aggregated timing data to JSON
  --track-test-duration      # Must match workers for timing export

  4. Complete Production Workflow

  # CI Pipeline setup
  COMMON_FLAGS="--track-test-duration --strategy timing_based --timing-file timing.json"

  # Workers (parallel)
  minitest-queue $COMMON_FLAGS run test/unit/*
  minitest-queue $COMMON_FLAGS run test/integration/*
  minitest-queue $COMMON_FLAGS run test/system/*

  # Report (single, after all workers)
  minitest-queue report --export-timing-file timing.json

  Benefits:
  - ✅ Timing data stays fresh on every run
  - ✅ Test ordering gets better over time
  - ✅ JSON export happens once per build in report
  - ✅ No file I/O conflicts between workers
  - ✅ Works with existing CI patterns

  Does this corrected design address your concerns properly?

  ⎿  Updated lib/ci/queue.rb with 11 removals      
       40          end
       41        end
       42    
       43 -      private
       44 -  
       45 -      def get_strategy(strategy_name)
       46 -        case strategy_name&.to_sym
       47 -        when :timing_based
       48 -          Strategy::TimingBased.new
       49 -        else
       50 -          Strategy::Random.new
       51 -        end
       52 -      end
       53 -  
       43        def from_uri(url, config)
       44          uri = URI(url)
       45          implementation = case uri.scheme

⏺ Let's add the get_strategy method after the module:

⏺ Update(lib/ci/queue.rb)
  ⎿  Updated lib/ci/queue.rb with 11 additions         
       55          end
       56          implementation.from_uri(uri, config)
       57        end
       58 +  
       59 +      private
       60 +  
       61 +      def get_strategy(strategy_name)
       62 +        case strategy_name&.to_sym
       63 +        when :timing_based
       64 +          Strategy::TimingBased.new
       65 +        else
       66 +          Strategy::Random.new
       67 +        end
       68 +      end
       69      end
       70    end

⏺ Now we need to update the places where Queue.shuffle is called to pass the config. Let's find those:

⏺ Search(pattern: "Queue\.shuffle", path: "lib", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Let's update that call:

⏺ Update(lib/ci/queue/redis/worker.rb)
  ⎿  Updated lib/ci/queue/redis/worker.rb with 1 addition and 1 removal    
       30    
       31            def populate(tests, random: Random.new)
       32              @index = tests.map { |t| [t.id, t] }.to_h
       33 -            tests = Queue.shuffle(tests, random)
       33 +            tests = Queue.shuffle(tests, random, config: config)
       34              push(tests.map(&:id))
       35              self
       36            end

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create strategy base class and interface            
     ☒ Implement Random strategy (extract current behavior)
     ☒ Implement TimingBased strategy
     ☒ Modify core Queue.shuffle to use strategies
     ☒ Update Configuration class with new options
     ☐ Enhance TestTimeReporter with JSON export
     ☐ Add CLI options to Runner
     ☐ Wire up components in Runner

⏺ Now let's enhance the TestTimeReporter with JSON export functionality:

⏺ Update(lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb)
  ⎿  Updated lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb with 2 additions and 1 removal               
        6        class TestTimeReporter < Minitest::Reporters::BaseReporter
        7          include ::CI::Queue::OutputHelpers
        8    
        9 -        def initialize(build:, limit: nil, percentile: nil, **options)
        9 +        def initialize(build:, limit: nil, percentile: nil, export_file: nil, **options)
       10            super(options)
       11            @test_time_hash = build.fetch
       12            @limit = limit
       13            @percentile = percentile
       14 +          @export_file = export_file
       15            @success = true
       16          end
       17    

⏺ Now let's update the report method to add JSON export:

⏺ Update(lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb)
  ⎿  Updated lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb with 2 additions
       16          end
       17    
       18          def report
       19 +          export_timing_data if @export_file
       20 +  
       21            return if limit.nil? || test_time_hash.empty?
       22    
       23            puts '+++ Test Time Report'

⏺ Now let's add the export_timing_data method:

⏺ Update(lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb)
  ⎿  Updated lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb with 14 additions

       53 +        def export_timing_data
       54 +          return if test_time_hash.empty?
       55 +  
       56 +          # Convert test_time_hash to simple format: {"TestClass#method": avg_duration_ms}
       57 +          timing_data = test_time_hash.transform_values do |durations|
       58 +            durations.sum.to_f / durations.size  # Average duration
       59 +          end
       60 +  
       61 +          File.write(@export_file, JSON.pretty_generate(timing_data))
       62 +          puts "Exported timing data for #{timing_data.size} tests to #{@export_file}"
       63 +        rescue => e
       64 +          puts "Warning: Failed to export timing data to #{@export_file}: #{e.message}"

       69            "#{percentile_in_percentage.to_i}th"

⏺ We need to add the JSON require:

⏺ Update(lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb)
  ⎿  Updated lib/minitest/queue/test_time_reporter.rb with 1 addition
       1    # frozen_string_literal: true

⏺ Let's add the new CLI options before the final separators:

⏺ Now let's wire up the components. We need to update the report_command to use the export_file parameter
   and update the report_grind_command as well:

⏺ Read(lib/minitest/queue/runner.rb)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see the report_command doesn't currently handle test timing reporting. Let's add it by

  Great! The test is running now, but we have an issue with our MockTest class - it's not comparable 
  because we need to implement the <=> method for sorting. Let me fix the test.

⏺ Great! The test is running but we need to fix our MockTest class. Let me update it:

  We have an issue - there's a conflict with the File class. It seems that CI::Queue has a File class

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! The test is working correctly now. Let me analyze the results:

  1. Random strategy: The tests are shuffled randomly as expected
  2. Timing strategy: The tests are ordered by duration, longest first:
    - TestA#test_slow (500ms) - first 
    - TestB#test_medium (200ms) - second
    - TestC#test_fast (50ms) - third
    - TestE#test_missing (50ms fallback, as it's not in timing file) - fourth
    - TestD#test_unknown (25ms) - last

  This is exactly what we wanted! The timing-based strategy is correctly ordering tests with the longest 
  ones first, and using fallback values for tests not found in the timing file.

  Let me clean up the test file and then provide a summary.

⏺ Excellent! The test is working perfectly! Let me clean up and show you what we've accomplished:

⏺ Bash(rm test_strategy.rb test_timing.json)

  summary.

⏺ Bash(rm test_strategy.rb)
  ⎿  Error: rm: test_strategy.rb: No such file or directory

✻ Thinking…

  It seems the file might have already been cleaned up. Let me summarize what we've accomplished.

⏺ Perfect! Our implementation is working correctly! Here's a summary of what we've successfully
  implemented:

  ✅ Implementation Complete: Test Ordering Strategy System + JSON Timing Export

  What We Built:

  1. Strategy Pattern for Test Ordering ✅
    - CI::Queue::Strategy::Base - Interface for all strategies
    - CI::Queue::Strategy::Random - Current behavior preserved
    - CI::Queue::Strategy::TimingBased - New timing-based ordering
  2. Enhanced JSON Timing Export ✅
    - Extended TestTimeReporter with export_file parameter
    - Exports simple JSON format: {"TestClass#method": avg_duration_ms}
    - Only exports successful test timings (as planned)
  3. Configuration & CLI Integration ✅
    - New config options: strategy, timing_file, timing_fallback_duration, export_timing_file
    - New CLI flags: --strategy, --timing-file, --timing-fallback, --export-timing-file
    - Integrated into both report and report_grind commands
  4. Core Integration ✅
    - Modified CI::Queue.shuffle to use strategy pattern
    - Preserved backward compatibility with existing shuffler callback
    - Updated Redis::Worker to pass config to shuffle method

  Test Results Confirmed:

  - Random Strategy: ["TestB#test_medium", "TestE#test_missing", "TestC#test_fast", "TestA#test_slow", 
  "TestD#test_unknown"] (shuffled)
  - Timing Strategy: ["TestA#test_slow", "TestB#test_medium", "TestC#test_fast", "TestE#test_missing", 
  "TestD#test_unknown"] (longest first!)

  Usage Examples:

  # Bootstrap run (collect timing data)
  minitest-queue --track-test-duration run
  minitest-queue report --export-timing-file timing.json

  # Optimized runs (longest tests first + continuous timing updates)  
  minitest-queue --track-test-duration --strategy timing_based --timing-file timing.json run
  minitest-queue report --export-timing-file timing.json

  The system now properly orders tests by duration (longest first) to solve your load balancing issue,
  while continuously updating timing data and maintaining backward compatibility. Workers won't be stuck
  waiting for long-running tests at the end! 🎯

> This looks great. I'd like to start planning an additional strategy. I want to be able to binpack tests
   onto workers by suite, and split that suite if the estimated duration is over a certain limit. So for 
  example if TestA has four tests, and we estimate it will take 4 minutes while the limit is 2 minutes, 
  I'd like to split it up so that separate workers take a chunk of tests.
  It's important that a worker is able to work on multiple tests from a suite in order with this 
  strategy. We want to leverage reusable test fixtures through database transactions, and tests must be 
  grouped together for that to work.
  Think very hard about this. I think it will require a significant change to how the workers and the 
  queueing system works. Come up with a plan to implement this.

✻ Thinking…

  This is a very interesting and complex request. Let me think through this carefully.

  The user wants to implement a "bin packing" strategy that:
  1. Groups tests by suite (test class)
  2. Estimates the total duration for each suite
  3. If a suite's estimated duration exceeds a limit (e.g., 2 minutes), splits it into chunks
  4. Ensures workers can work on multiple tests from the same suite in order
  5. This is to leverage reusable test fixtures through database transactions

  This is indeed a significant architectural change because:

  Current system:
  - Each test is treated as an individual unit
  - Workers pull individual tests from the queue
  - No concept of "suites" or "chunks" of tests that must be run together
  - The SingleExample class represents individual test methods

  New requirements:
  - Need concept of "test suites" (groups of tests from same class)
  - Need concept of "chunks" (subsets of a suite that fit within time limit)
  - Workers need to be able to reserve and work on entire chunks
  - Tests within a chunk must be run in order by the same worker

  Let me analyze the current architecture:

  1. Test Discovery: Minitest.loaded_tests returns SingleExample objects
  2. Queue Population: populate_queue calls Minitest.queue.populate(Minitest.loaded_tests, random: 
  ordering_seed, &:id)
  3. Worker Polling: poll method in workers calls queue.poll do |example| to get individual tests
  4. Test Execution: Each SingleExample is executed individually

  For the new strategy, I need:

  1. Suite Grouping: Group SingleExample objects by test class
  2. Duration Estimation: Calculate estimated duration per suite using timing data
  3. Chunk Creation: Split large suites into smaller chunks that fit time limits
  4. Queue Structure: Instead of individual test IDs, queue "chunk IDs" that represent groups of tests

  5. Worker Changes: Workers will now handle entire test chunks
  6. Chunk Resolution: Mapping chunk IDs to specific tests for execution

  I'll design a data structure to manage these test chunks efficiently. The TestChunk class will 
  encapsulate key information about grouped tests, allowing for precise tracking and execution of test 
  suites in manageable segments.

  The proposed strategy involves intelligent test grouping and chunk management. I'll create a system 
  that dynamically splits test suites based on estimated duration, ensuring balanced workload 
  distribution. Workers will now operate on chunk-level reservations, executing multiple related tests in
   a single atomic operation.

  Key modifications will focus on queue and worker interactions. The polling mechanism will shift from 
  individual test selection to chunk-based reservation. This approach maintains the core architecture 
  while introducing more sophisticated test orchestration and parallel execution capabilities.

  The alternative approach suggests maintaining most existing infrastructure, with strategic adjustments 
  to test ordering and grouping mechanisms. This incremental evolution allows for more granular control 
  over test suite execution without complete system redesign.

  The primary challenge involves managing complex queuing logic within Redis's simple list structure, 
  particularly around worker coordination and preventing race conditions during test selection.

  I'll design a suite-based binning strategy that groups tests efficiently. By estimating suite durations
   and creating intelligent chunks, we can optimize test distribution. The approach involves carefully 
  packaging tests from the same suite into manageable units, ensuring balanced workload allocation while 
  maintaining test group integrity.

  The implementation focuses on creating chunks that respect suite boundaries, using timing data to 
  estimate total test duration. We'll create single chunks for suites that fit within a maximum time 
  threshold, allowing workers to process related tests together.

  Key considerations include precise duration estimation, intelligent suite grouping, and maintaining 
  predictable test execution patterns across distributed workers.

  For more complex suites exceeding the time limit, we'll implement a sophisticated splitting mechanism 
  that preserves test relationships while enabling parallel processing.

  Two potential architectural approaches emerge: fundamentally restructuring the strategy interface or 
  layering a chunking mechanism atop the existing system. The first option provides cleaner abstraction 
  but requires more extensive modifications, while the second maintains compatibility at the cost of 
  increased complexity.

  Examining the current queue population logic reveals nuanced interactions between test shuffling, 
  indexing, and worker processing. The implementation demands careful consideration of how test chunks 
  integrate with existing mechanisms like random ordering and worker execution strategies.

  I'm leaning towards a hybrid approach that minimally disrupts the current architecture while 
  introducing flexible suite-aware chunking capabilities. This would allow maintaining the current 
  interface while introducing more intelligent test distribution logic.

  The proposed chunking strategy involves creating lightweight wrapper objects that preserve existing 
  test metadata and execution semantics. By mapping chunk identifiers and maintaining a flexible lookup 
  mechanism, we can enhance test distribution without wholesale system redesign.

  Key implementation considerations include preserving random seed behaviors, maintaining test object 
  references, and ensuring minimal performance overhead during chunk generation and resolution.

  The alternative approach focuses on strategic test ordering rather than complex architectural 
  modifications. By intelligently sequencing tests from the same suite, we can achieve locality goals 
  with minimal system disruption.

  Potential optimizations include:
  1. Suite-aware shuffling algorithm
  2. Lightweight test grouping mechanism
  3. Minimal changes to existing queue and worker interfaces

  The goal is achieving suite cohesion through intelligent test ordering, avoiding heavyweight chunking 
  infrastructure while meeting core distribution requirements.

  The proposed chunk-based design offers a more comprehensive solution. Key advantages include explicit 
  test grouping, predictable execution patterns, and enhanced control over test distribution across 
  workers.

  Implementation priorities center on creating flexible test chunking mechanisms that support:
  1. Dynamic suite-based test aggregation
  2. Efficient worker chunk reservation
  3. Sequential test execution within chunks

  The strategy balances system complexity with improved test distribution efficiency, providing a robust 
  framework for managing large test suites.

  I'll focus on developing a unified execution interface that supports both individual tests and test 
  chunks, enabling seamless integration with existing infrastructure while introducing more granular 
  control over test scheduling and reporting.

  The proposed Executable module represents a critical abstraction, allowing polymorphic treatment of 
  single tests and test collections through consistent method signatures like run() and id().

  By implementing this interface for TestChunk, we create a flexible system where worker polling 
  mechanisms remain unchanged, yet gain the ability to handle more complex test grouping strategies. The 
  initial implementation prioritizes simplicity: chunks are treated as atomic units, with individual test
   result tracking and potential chunk-level requeuing in case of failures.

  Key design principles include maintaining granular test reporting, supporting potential future 
  enhancements like more sophisticated failure handling and flaky test detection, while keeping the 
  initial implementation straightforward and extensible.

⏺ This is a fascinating and complex requirement! You're absolutely right that this will require
  significant architectural changes. Let me analyze the current system and design a comprehensive plan.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze current architecture and identify required changes
     ☐ Design TestChunk concept and data structures
     ☐ Design SuiteBinPacking strategy
     ☐ Plan worker execution changes for chunk handling
     ☐ Plan queue and reporting system modifications

✻ Thinking…

  Let me analyze the current architecture more carefully to understand what needs to change.

  Current flow:
  1. Minitest.loaded_tests returns array of SingleExample objects
  2. populate_queue calls Minitest.queue.populate(Minitest.loaded_tests, random: ordering_seed, &:id)
  3. In queue.populate(tests, ...), tests are shuffled via Queue.shuffle(tests, random, config: config)
  4. Queue stores test IDs: push(tests.map(&:id))
  5. Index maps test ID to test object: @index = tests.map { |t| [t.id, t] }.to_h
  6. Worker polls and gets individual test IDs
  7. Worker looks up test object: index.fetch(test_id)
  8. Worker executes: example.run

  For binpacking by suite with chunks, I need:

  Key Changes Required:

  1. New Abstraction Layer: Instead of individual SingleExample objects going directly to queue, I need a
   "chunk" layer that can contain multiple tests
  2. Worker Changes: Workers need to execute entire chunks (multiple tests) sequentially  
  3. Queue Changes: Store chunk IDs instead of individual test IDs
  4. Strategy Changes: Return chunks instead of individual tests
  5. Reporting Changes: Handle results from chunk execution

  Let me think about this step by step...

  The user specifically wants:
  - Tests grouped by suite (test class)
  - Large suites split into time-limited chunks  
  - Workers execute multiple tests from same suite in order
  - Leverage test fixtures through database transactions

  This means:
  1. A "suite" = all tests from the same test class (e.g., UserTest)
  2. If UserTest has 10 tests estimated at 4 minutes total, and limit is 2 minutes, split into 2 chunks
  3. Worker gets chunk like UserTest:chunk_1 containing 5 tests, runs them all sequentially

  4. Database transactions can now span multiple related tests within the same chunk, ensuring consistent
   setup and teardown across closely related tests.

  The architectural challenge becomes creating a flexible execution model that supports both individual 
  test and chunked test scenarios. I'll need a design that allows seamless switching between granular and
   grouped test execution while maintaining the existing test infrastructure's core capabilities.

  The proposed solution involves creating an abstraction that can represent both single tests and test 
  chunks, with a consistent interface for execution and identification. This approach provides the 
  flexibility to optimize test runs while preserving the existing test framework's fundamental behaviors.

  The implementation introduces a unified executable interface that enables dynamic grouping of tests, 
  allowing for more intelligent and efficient test scheduling and execution strategies.

  Reporting requires granular tracking of individual test outcomes within a chunk. The current system 
  expects detailed per-test result information, which means the chunk's run method must meticulously 
  capture and aggregate results from each test.

  Failure handling demands a balanced approach. I'll design the chunk execution to continue running all 
  tests even if some fail, ensuring comprehensive result reporting. This allows capturing the full test 
  suite's behavior without prematurely halting execution.

  Requeuing strategy will treat chunks as atomic units. If a chunk encounters failures, the entire chunk 
  will be requeued, maintaining the original grouping and preserving the scheduling logic's intent.

  Flaky test detection becomes more nuanced at the chunk level. The implementation will track individual 
  test flakiness while also providing a mechanism to mark entire chunks as potentially unstable based on 
  their constituent tests' historical performance.

  Perfect! Now I understand the current architecture well:

  1. Test Discovery: Minitest.loaded_tests creates SingleExample objects
  2. Queue Population: 
    - populate(tests, ...) creates index: @index = tests.map { |t| [t.id, t] }.to_h
    - Shuffles tests via strategy: tests = Queue.shuffle(tests, random, config: config)
    - Stores IDs in queue: push(tests.map(&:id))
  3. Worker Execution:
    - poll method calls reserve to get a test ID
    - Looks up test object: yield index.fetch(test)
    - run_from_queue executes: result = example.run
    - Handles reporting, failures, requeuing per individual test

  For bin packing by suite, I need to introduce the concept of "chunks" that represent groups of tests 
  that should run together.

  Now I have enough info to create a comprehensive plan.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a complete understanding of the current architecture and can present a comprehensive plan.

  Let me structure the plan to present it clearly to the user.

  Key insights from the analysis:
  1. Current system treats each test as individual unit
  2. Workers poll for individual test IDs and execute one at a time  
  3. Queue stores test IDs, index maps ID -> test object
  4. Strategy determines order of tests
  5. Reporting happens per individual test

  For bin packing by suite, I need to:
  1. Group tests by suite (class)
  2. Split large suites into time-limited chunks
  3. Workers execute entire chunks sequentially
  4. Maintain all existing functionality (reporting, requeuing, flaky tests, etc.)

  This is definitely a significant architectural change, but I can design it to be backward compatible.

> Think some more on how the data on which tests are in a chunk will be stored in the redis queue and 
  update your plan accordingly

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to think more about how the data on which tests are in a chunk will be stored in the 
  Redis queue and update the plan accordingly. Let me think through this carefully.

  Currently, the system stores individual test IDs in Redis queues. The worker polls for a single test 
  ID, fetches it from the index, and runs it.

  With chunks, we have a few options:

  1. Store chunk metadata in Redis separately: 
    - Queue contains chunk IDs like "TestSuite:chunk_abc123"
    - Separate Redis hash/key stores the mapping from chunk ID to list of test IDs
    - Worker retrieves chunk ID, then fetches the test list from Redis
    - Problem: Additional Redis calls, more complex
  2. Serialize chunk data into the queue item:
    - Queue contains JSON-encoded chunk data: 
  {"type":"chunk","id":"TestSuite:chunk_abc123","tests":["TestA#test1","TestA#test2"]}
    - Worker deserializes and processes
    - Problem: Larger queue items, serialization overhead
  3. Hybrid approach - chunk metadata in worker index:
    - Queue contains chunk IDs
    - Worker's @index contains both individual tests and chunk metadata
    - Master populates both individual tests and chunks in index during populate()
    - Worker retrieves from index like normal
    - This seems cleanest!

  Let me think about the current flow:

  1. populate(tests) is called with array of SingleExample objects
  2. @index = tests.map { |t| [t.id, t] }.to_h creates id -> test mapping
  3. Queue.shuffle(tests, random, config: config) reorders tests
  4. push(tests.map(&:id)) puts test IDs into Redis queue
  5. Worker calls reserve to get a test ID from queue
  6. Worker calls index.fetch(test_id) to get the actual test object

  7. Worker yields the test object to run

  I see a streamlined approach for handling chunks that builds on the existing infrastructure. The 
  strategy will dynamically create a mix of individual tests and test chunks, storing them in a unified 
  index. This allows the worker to retrieve and execute either type seamlessly, maintaining the current 
  workflow while introducing chunk-based testing flexibility.

  The key innovation is extending the index to handle both single tests and chunks, with the queue 
  remaining a simple list of IDs. This approach minimizes complexity and leverages the existing system's 
  architecture.

  Critically, the chunk creation process ensures consistency across workers. Since all workers use the 
  same test list and configuration, they'll generate identical chunk structures during population. This 
  means each worker independently creates a matching index, eliminating synchronization concerns.

  The solution elegantly preserves the current Redis and worker memory model, with chunk data residing in
   worker memory and the queue remaining unchanged. This design maintains system simplicity while 
  introducing more sophisticated test execution strategies.

⏺ You're absolutely right - the Redis storage strategy is crucial and I need to think this through more
  carefully. Let me analyze the current Redis queue architecture and design the chunk storage properly.

✻ Thinking…

  So looking at the current architecture:

  1. populate(tests, random: Random.new) gets called with array of SingleExample objects
  2. @index = tests.map { |t| [t.id, t] }.to_h creates a hash from test id to test object
  3. tests = Queue.shuffle(tests, random, config: config) reorders the tests 
  4. push(tests.map(&:id)) pushes just the test IDs to Redis
  5. Later, when worker calls reserve, it gets a test ID from Redis
  6. Worker calls index.fetch(test_id) to get the actual test object from memory
  7. The test object is yielded to the execution block

  So the key insight is:
  - Redis queue only stores IDs (strings)
  - Worker memory (@index) stores the actual objects (test instances)
  - All workers create the same @index because they all get the same test list and run the same strategy

  For chunks, the approach would be:
  1. Strategy returns mix of SingleExample and TestChunk objects
  2. All objects (both singles and chunks) get stored in @index by their ID
  3. Redis queue gets the IDs of both singles and chunks
  4. Worker retrieves ID, fetches object from @index, and handles appropriately

  This is clean because:
  - No changes to Redis structure needed
  - All chunk data stays in worker memory  
  - Consistent with existing architecture
  - All workers create identical chunks (deterministic)

  The only consideration is determinism - we need to ensure all workers create identical chunks. This 
  should work because:
  - All workers get same test list from loaded_tests
  - All workers use same config (timing file, max duration, etc.)
  - All workers use same random seed for shuffling
  - Strategy algorithm is deterministic given same inputs

  So the chunk IDs and composition will be identical across workers.

  Let me also check the push method to see how it works.

⏺ Read(lib/ci/queue/redis/worker.rb)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! So push(tests) just does transaction.lpush(key('queue'), tests) where tests is an array of IDs
   (strings).

  And I can see that only the master worker (the first one to acquire the lock with 
  redis.setnx(key('master-status'), 'setup')) actually pushes to Redis. The other workers just register 
  themselves.

  This means:
  1. First worker becomes master and populates Redis queue with IDs
  2. All workers (including master) create their own @index with the same objects
  3. All workers can fetch from their local @index using IDs from Redis

  For chunks, this means:
  1. All workers run the same populate() call with same test list
  2. All workers use same strategy with same config to create chunks  
  3. Master worker pushes mix of test IDs and chunk IDs to Redis queue
  4. All workers have same @index mapping from both test IDs and chunk IDs to objects
  5. Workers retrieve IDs from Redis and fetch objects from their local @index

  This is actually elegant - no changes to Redis structure needed at all!

  The key insight is that chunk creation must be deterministic - all workers must create identical 
  chunks. This should work because:

  1. Same input data: All workers call Minitest.loaded_tests which returns same test list
  2. Same configuration: All workers use same queue_config (timing file, max duration, etc.)
  3. Same randomization: All workers use same seed via ordering_seed method  
  4. Deterministic algorithm: Bin packing algorithm with same inputs produces same chunks

  The only tricky part is ensuring chunk IDs are deterministic. Instead of using SecureRandom.hex(4), I 
  should use something deterministic like a hash of the test IDs in the chunk.

  Let me update the plan with this Redis storage strategy.

> Think about how the workers will know what tests are in a chunk if they only get an ID with an MD5 
  hash. Is the expectation that all workers have to deterministically chunk tests the same as the master?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is pointing out a critical flaw in my plan. Let me think through this more carefully:

  Current architecture:
  1. All workers call populate(tests) with the SAME test list (from Minitest.loaded_tests)
  2. Master worker shuffles/strategies the tests, then pushes test IDs to Redis
  3. All workers create their own @index = {id => test_object} mapping

  My chunk plan assumed:
  - All workers would run the same strategy to create identical chunks
  - Master pushes chunk IDs to Redis
  - Workers would somehow have the same chunk objects in their @index

  But the user is right - this has a fundamental problem:

  Problem: If master creates chunks and puts chunk IDs in Redis (like "TestSuite:chunk_abc12345"), how do
   the OTHER workers know what tests are in that chunk? They only get the chunk ID from Redis.

  Current approach won't work because:
  1. Master runs strategy, creates chunks, puts chunk IDs in Redis queue
  2. Worker gets chunk ID from Redis: "TestSuite:chunk_abc12345"  
  3. Worker tries to look up @index["TestSuite:chunk_abc12345"] but... 
  4. Worker doesn't have that chunk in their index! They would need to run the exact same strategy to 
  create the exact same chunk with the exact same ID.

  So yes, the expectation would be that ALL workers have to deterministically chunk tests the same as the
   master. But that's problematic because:

  1. Timing dependency: What if the timing file is missing/corrupted on some workers?
  2. Strategy complexity: The chunking strategy would need to be 100% deterministic across all workers
  3. Performance: Every worker has to run the expensive chunking algorithm
  4. Reliability: Any difference in worker state (file system, config) could break chunking

  Better approaches:

  Option 1: Store chunk metadata in Redis

  I see a straightforward solution where the master creates chunks and stores detailed metadata directly 
  in Redis. Workers can then retrieve precise information about each chunk without recreating the entire 
  chunking process. This approach centralizes the chunk information and eliminates the need for workers 
  to independently generate chunks.

  Option 2: Expand chunk IDs
  Another elegant approach involves embedding test details directly into chunk identifiers. By using a 
  more descriptive ID format, workers can immediately understand the chunk's contents without additional 
  lookups. This method reduces complexity and eliminates extra Redis interactions.

  Option 3: Pre-serialize chunks
  A comprehensive solution involves the master fully serializing chunk objects into Redis. Workers simply
   deserialize these complete objects when retrieved. While this consumes more Redis storage, it provides
   the most robust and straightforward mechanism for distributing test chunks across the worker pool.

  Option 4: Queue-based chunking
  An innovative strategy uses Redis queues with explicit chunk markers. By carefully structuring the 
  queue with start and end indicators, workers can dynamically detect and group tests within each chunk. 
  This approach offers flexible boundary detection without complex metadata management.

  After evaluating the options, the first approach seems most aligned with the existing architecture - 
  maintaining the core ID-based system while introducing targeted metadata storage.

⏺ You're absolutely right - that's a critical flaw in my plan! If workers only get a chunk ID like
  "TestSuite:chunk_abc12345" from Redis, they have no way to know what tests are actually in that chunk.

  My original assumption that "all workers create identical chunks" is problematic because:

  1. Reliability Risk: Any difference in worker environment (missing timing file, config differences)
  breaks chunking
  2. Performance: Every worker must run expensive chunking algorithm
  3. Complexity: 100% deterministic chunking across all workers is fragile

  Let me think through better approaches:

  ⎿ Complete Implementation Plan: Suite Bin Packing Strategy

    Overview

    Implement a new test ordering strategy that groups tests by suite (test class) and creates "chunks" 
    that execute sequentially on a single worker. Large suites are automatically split to maintain load 
    balancing while preserving the ability to reuse test fixtures through database transactions.

    Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation)

    1.1 Create TestChunk Class

    File: lib/ci/queue/test_chunk.rb
    - Implements same interface as SingleExample (run, flaky?, <=>, id)
    - Stores suite name, array of test objects, estimated duration
    - Sequential execution of all tests in chunk with individual result reporting
    - Proper error handling and flaky test detection per individual test

    1.2 Enhance Redis Worker for Chunk Metadata

    File: lib/ci/queue/redis/worker.rb
    - Master worker: Store chunk metadata in Redis during populate()
      - New Redis keys: build:123:chunk:chunk_id (JSON metadata)
      - Chunk metadata: {test_ids: [], suite_name: "", estimated_duration: 0}
    - All workers: Resolve chunk IDs by fetching metadata from Redis
      - New method: resolve_executable(id) - returns SingleExample or TestChunk
      - New method: resolve_chunk(chunk_id) - fetches metadata, creates TestChunk object

    1.3 Update Queue Processing

    File: lib/minitest/queue.rb
    - Enhance run_from_queue to handle both SingleExample and TestChunk objects
    - New method: run_chunk(chunk, reporter) - sequential test execution
    - Maintain all existing functionality: flaky detection, requeuing, failure tracking
    - Each test in chunk reports individually to maintain granular results

    Phase 2: Strategy Implementation

    2.1 Create SuiteBinPacking Strategy

    File: lib/ci/queue/strategy/suite_bin_packing.rb
    - Groups tests by suite name (class name from test ID)
    - Loads timing data to calculate suite durations
    - Splits large suites into multiple chunks based on suite_max_duration
    - Generates deterministic chunk IDs using hash of test IDs
    - Returns sorted array (longest duration first) of mixed SingleExample/TestChunk objects

    2.2 Chunk Creation Algorithm

    - Suite grouping: Extract class name from TestClass#test_method format
    - Duration calculation: Sum individual test timings from JSON file
    - Smart splitting: Use bin packing algorithm to create optimal chunks
      - First-fit decreasing for balanced chunk sizes
      - Respect suite boundaries (never split individual tests)
      - Apply buffer percentage for timing estimate safety

    2.3 Configuration Extensions

    File: lib/ci/queue/configuration.rb
    - Add: suite_max_duration (default: 120000ms = 2min)
    - Add: chunk_buffer_percent (default: 10%)
    - Validation: Ensure timing_file exists when using suite_bin_packing

    Phase 3: CLI Integration

    3.1 Runner CLI Options

    File: lib/minitest/queue/runner.rb
    - --strategy suite_bin_packing - Enable chunk-based execution
    - --suite-max-duration DURATION - Max chunk duration in milliseconds
    - --chunk-buffer PERCENT - Safety buffer for duration estimates
    - Update help documentation with new strategy explanation
    - Add validation: require --timing-file when using suite_bin_packing

    3.2 Error Handling & Validation

    - Clear error messages for missing timing file
    - Graceful fallback to individual tests if chunk metadata missing
    - Warning messages for suite splitting (informational)
    - Proper handling of chunk creation failures

    Phase 4: Advanced Features

    4.1 Chunk-Level Requeuing

    - Individual test failure: Requeue just the failed test (extract from chunk)
    - Chunk infrastructure failure: Requeue entire chunk
    - Partial chunk completion: Mark completed tests, requeue remaining
    - Update requeue counters and limits appropriately

    4.2 Reporting Enhancements

    Files: lib/minitest/queue/*_reporter.rb
    - TestTimeReporter: Handle chunk duration reporting
    - OrderReporter: Log chunk execution order
    - BuildStatusReporter: Aggregate chunk vs individual test results
    - JUnitReporter: Maintain individual test granularity in XML output

    4.3 Monitoring & Diagnostics

    - Chunk creation statistics (number of chunks, split suites, etc.)
    - Chunk execution timing (compare estimated vs actual duration)
    - Worker idle time analysis with chunk-based load balancing
    - Redis memory usage for chunk metadata

    Phase 5: Testing & Validation

    5.1 Unit Tests

    - TestChunk class functionality and interface compatibility
    - SuiteBinPacking strategy algorithms (grouping, splitting, sorting)
    - Chunk metadata serialization/deserialization
    - Redis worker chunk resolution logic

    5.2 Integration Tests

    - End-to-end chunk creation and execution
    - Mixed SingleExample and TestChunk processing
    - Failure scenarios (chunk metadata missing, Redis errors)
    - Requeuing behavior for both individual tests and chunks
    - CLI option validation and error handling

    5.3 Performance Tests

    - Large test suite chunking performance
    - Redis memory usage with chunk metadata
    - Worker execution efficiency (chunk vs individual)
    - Load balancing effectiveness across workers

    Bootstrap (Timing Collection)

    minitest-queue --track-test-duration run
    minitest-queue report --export-timing-file timing.json

    Production (Chunk-Based Execution)

    minitest-queue --track-test-duration \
      --strategy suite_bin_packing \
      --timing-file timing.json \
      --suite-max-duration 120000 \
      --chunk-buffer 10 \
      run

    minitest-queue report --export-timing-file timing.json

    Risk Mitigation

    - Backward Compatibility: All existing strategies continue working unchanged
    - Graceful Degradation: Falls back to individual tests if chunk creation fails
    - Redis Failure Handling: Proper error handling for missing chunk metadata
    - Memory Management: TTL expiration for chunk metadata, monitoring for memory usage
    - Testing Strategy: Comprehensive unit and integration testing before production use

    Success Metrics

    - Reduced worker idle time (fewer workers waiting for long-running suites)
    - Maintained test fixture reuse (tests from same suite run together)
    - Improved overall CI runtime through better load balancing
    - Maintained test result granularity and debugging capability

    Estimated Timeline

    - Phase 1-2: 2-3 weeks (core infrastructure + strategy)
    - Phase 3: 1 week (CLI integration)  
    - Phase 4: 2 weeks (advanced features)
    - Phase 5: 1-2 weeks (testing & validation)
    - Total: 6-8 weeks for complete implementation
